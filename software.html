<h2>Variational Bayesian Linear Gaussian State-Space Models</h2>

<p>MATLAB implementation of a Bayesian approach to Linear Gaussian State-Space Models (LGSSMs), 
also called Linear Dynamical Systems, where Gaussian and Wishart prior distributions on the model parameters are used. 
Model Intractability is addressed by using a variational approximation scheme where inference is reformulated such that 
any standard Kalman filtering/smoothing routine can be employed (here we implemented the standard predictor-corrector 
Kalman filtering routine and the Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoothing routine).</p>
