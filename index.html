<p> I am a research scientist at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTJ">DeepMind</a>.
    I received a Diploma di Laurea in Mathematics from University of Bologna 
    and a PhD in Machine Learning from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (IDIAP Research Institute). 
    I worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the Max-Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, 
    in the Department of Empirical Inference led by Bernhard Schölkopf, and at Microsoft Research Cambridge, 
    in the Machine Learning and Perception Group led by Christopher Bishop; 
    and I held a Marie-Curie Intra-European Fellowship at the Statistical Laboratory University of Cambridge, 
    with Philip Dawid as scientist in charge. 
    My research interests are based around Bayesian reasoning, graphical models, approximate inference, 
    time-series models, deep learning, and reinforcement learning.</p>
