<p>My name is Jonathan Robson, and this is my personal website. Vocationally, I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer
on the Platform Team at <a href="http://www.wikia.com/Wikia">Wikia</a> in San Francisco where I build awesome
distributed systems and tools, mostly in Python. Avocationally, I'm an open-source software developer, Linux enthusiast,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTJ">INTJ</a>, speedcuber, dog lover, musician, and nerd. Educationally, I'm a
philosopher, mathematician, and physicist. I also like to consider myself a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath">polymath</a> and somewhat of an amateur anthropologist.</p>

<p>I was born, raised, and educated in Wichita, Kansas, and no, it's <em>not</em> as boring there as you might think.
In 2007, I moved to the Kansas City Metro Area&mdash;which I now consider home more than Wichita, even after
subsequently moving to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2013. I'll always be a midwesterner at heart, but I love to explore
new places and new opportunities.</p>

<p>You can find me in a variety of places on the web:</p>
